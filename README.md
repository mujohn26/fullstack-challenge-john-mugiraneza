# Fullstack Software Engineer Challenge

### The Challenge
Given a JSON file of pull requests comments in a fake GitHub repository, generate a visualization that provides valuable insight about the team and its developers. The purpose of the challenge is demonstrate your coding ability and gain an understanding of your design and problem solving skills. Feel free to take as little or as much time as you need for this challenge, we are looking to understand how you design and code with React.

The fake data to visualize is stored in `prComments.json`. Each pull request comment includes when it was written, who it was written by and on which pull request. `commentTopic` is the overall theme of the comment content, while `commentType` is the intention of the comment.

**If you have an existing React project that shows off your skills, you are more than welcome to share this with us and instead focus on designing and descibing how you would implement this challenge (no need to code it!)**

### Requirements
Please include all of the following when building your app. 
- Use React to build client app
- Answer questions below

### Bonus (if you want to flex ðŸ’ª / have some extra fun!)
- Setup an API to serve the data (preferably Node or Python)
- Set-up a database, define a schema to represent the JSON, and store the data in the database
- Use Redux for state management
- Make the web app responsive
- Host the app
